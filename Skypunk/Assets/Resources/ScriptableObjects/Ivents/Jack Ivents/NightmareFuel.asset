  TextHeader: NIGHTMARE FUEL
  Text: Even from afar, Jack could see the trail of fuel coming out of a damaged
    refueling station. Screams and calls for help were coming from the inside.
  VarA: Intervene
  TextA: Inside the station was nothing short of utter chaos. The roof has collapsed,
    trapping people under the debris, all the while damaged tech sparkled dangerously
    close to spilt fuel, threatening to ignite it any moment.

  VarB: Ignore
  TextB: To run saving strangers from a damaged building is both unsafe and pointless,
    Jack thought. He probably wouldn't accomplish much and might get himself in trouble
    instead. He continued on his way, pretending he saw and heard nothing.
