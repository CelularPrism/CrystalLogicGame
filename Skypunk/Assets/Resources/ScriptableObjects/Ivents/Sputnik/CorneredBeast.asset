  Text: A Gas Ganger ship passes you by at full speed, being chased by a Kerosener
    tribe. The pilot contacts you and relays that he has almost ran out of fuel,
    begging you for help.
  VarA: Refuse
  TextA: You want no business in this ordeal, besides the fact that helping a pirate
    is just a dumb move. From a safe distance, you watch the tribesmen catch up with
    the pirate ship and brutally execute its owner.

  VarB: Assist Him
  TextB: Covering the Gas Ganger ship with your own, you transfer the fuel, then
    follow him a safe distance away from his pursuers. As a sign of gratitude, he
    shares with you the spoils of his attacks on that tribe (-2 damage, -2 fuel).
