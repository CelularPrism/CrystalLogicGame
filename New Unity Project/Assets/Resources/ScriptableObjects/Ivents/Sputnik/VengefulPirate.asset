  TextHeader: VENGEFUL PIRATE
  Text: Crossing the sky with not a worry in your heart, it takes you some time to
    notice a Gas Ganger ship catching up with you. He comes on the radio with a graphic
    description of the many tortures he will inflict upon you. It would seem, he
    wants to take revenge on you for what you did earlier.

    After a while, you manage to break out of the chase, but this has taken a significant
    amount of fuel (-3 fuel).
