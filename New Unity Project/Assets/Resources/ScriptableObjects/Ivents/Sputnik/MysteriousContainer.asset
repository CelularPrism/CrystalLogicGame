  TextHeader: MYSTERIOUS CONTAINER
  Text: The expanse of skies between the islands is usually empty, however near this
    island you bear witness to a curious event - a large cargo container is caught
    in a kind of a gravitational vortex and, moving in a large spiral, slowly descends
    into the lower layers.

  VarA: Leave it Be
  TextA: This phenomena might be quite the sight to be seen, but approaching it is
    both dangerous and pointless. Having gotten your fair share of watching the container's
    movement, you, sensibly, leave it to its own devices.
