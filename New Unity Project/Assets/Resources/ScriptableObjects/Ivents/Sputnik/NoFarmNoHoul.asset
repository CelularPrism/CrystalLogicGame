  TextHeader: NO HARM, NO FOUL
  Text: Upon landing on this island, you notice two traders, judging by their look,
    having a heated debate. As you approach to ask what's going on, each one tells
    the other stole his supplies and asks to help solve the problem. One of them
    is chubby, well-groomed and well-dressed, while the other is gaunt, wears rags
    and generally looks like a beggar.
